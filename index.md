## Learn field hockey skills

This page is your first step in improving your hockey skills. Here is where you land after logging in and begin to take the next step forwards.

The content we provide for you is organised by type on the left side bar menu. All categories are organised from beginner onward, starting at Introduction and progressing in skill difficulty to maximum Level 5. There are How to videos for longer explanations of the foundation skills.

If you have experience playing hockey you could skip through to level 3 skills, as the earlier levels are to help the new player, but skipping is only recommended if you already know them.

If you want information covering tips on grips, body position, stages of learning the basics, and footwork you can find those in the levels Introduction, up to level 2.

If you are new to hockey, starting with the introduction videos gives you a step by step journey that can be followed or presented. Doing so gives you exposure to a diverse and large skill vocabulary to use in your games and practice.
